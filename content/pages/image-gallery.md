The three students in Design for the Theater: Scenery in the spring term of 2005 fed off each other's energies in exploring different media and production styles. As the two radically different approaches to the symbolist opera **Bluebeard's Castle** clearly show, they also established and confidently maintained their own styles as well.

In a design course like this, there are no "right" or "wrong" answers to a project. The students are in competition with themselves rather than with their classmates. Accomplishment is measured by their growing daring in exploring a visual world in response to the text, and by their willingness to experiment with materials and styles. At some point early in term. I make my students aware of one of my favorite quotes concerning the arts, by the Mexican author Carlos Chavez: "I live through risk. Without risk, there is no art. You should always be on the edge of a cliff about to fall down and break your neck."
