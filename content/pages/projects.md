Project Assignment/Description
------------------------------

These are the titles from which four of the five assignments will be chosen:

Strindberg, August. _The Father_.

Apollinaire, Guillaume. _The Breasts of Tiresias_.

Cocteau, Jean. _The Eiffel Tower Wedding Party_.

Lorca, Federico Garcia. _Blood Wedding_.

O'Neill, Eugene. _Long Day's Journer into Night_.

Bartok, Bela (Text by Bela Balazs). _Bluebeard's Castle_. (One Act Opera.)

Mascagni, Pietro (Text by Giovanni Targioni-Tozzetti). _Cavalleria Rusticana_. (One Act Opera.)

Strauss, Richard (Text by Hugo von Hofmannsthal). _Die Frau Ohne Schatten_. (Act One of the Opera only.)

The fifth title, serving as the course's final project, will be chosen by the student in collaboration with the Instructor, and is not limited to the list above.

Each assigned play is to be read in depth with extensive notes taken concerning the mood, setting of the play as written, physical requirements of the action and theme. In a paper, each student will present his or her concept on how to realize the play on stage, explaining and defending all choices made, whether a totally traditional recreation of the author's directions or a contemporary retelling employing updating, transfer of the location of the action, etc. Each project then proceeds through five class sessions, involving extensive discussion, revision and final presentation of a completed design. The Final Project, will be presented and defended at the last regular class session.
